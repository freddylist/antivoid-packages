# Antivoid packages

Collection of templates that should not be in the official xbps repositories.

Support mostly for `x86_64` as that is what I use.
I try to package for as many architectures as I can, but there is certainly no guarantee that they work on anything other than `x86_64`.
If a package is broken on another architecture and you have a fix for it, you are welcome to open a pull request.

I recommend using this with [freddylist/xbps-src-framework](https://github.com/freddylist/xbps-src-framework)
